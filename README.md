# Bike Sharing Dashboard ðŸš²

## Description

This is the final project from the Dicoding course "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python", aimed at processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from the chosen dataset, and creating a dashboard. I selected the Bike Sharing Dataset for this project. You can refer to the notebook file for the full process and documentation of this project. I utilized Streamlit to develop the dashboard, which you can access via the provided link or directly from here.

## 2. Project Work Cycle
1. Data Wrangling: 
	- Gathering data
	- Assessing data
	- Cleaning data
2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
	- Defining business questions for data exploration
	- Explorating data
3. Data Visualization:
	- Creating data visualizations to answer business questions
4. Dashboard Development:
	- Setting up libraries and the dataframes
	- Creating filter components for the dashboard
	- Implementing various data visualizations

## 3. Getting Started
1. Download this project to your local computer.
2. Open this project folder on your favorite IDE (Here I am using VS Code).
3. Ensure you have the necessary python environment or interpreter to run this project.
4. Install required Python libraries for your environment if you haven't already, such as Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Streamlit.
5. For `notebook.ipynb`, you can execute the code cells from top to bottom.
6. For `dashboard/dashboard.py`, you can run the file by opening the terminal and typing `streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py`, or `streamlit run dashboard.py` if you're already in the dashboard folder.
